										<h2><a href="#">Interest in IT</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>My interest in IT started right after joining the field of IT at the end of 2021. I was an IT technician for a few months as a contractor for the ATO, then moved into a similar role at the University of Melbourne. <br />
									   Usually, I do enjoy technology but never have I thought that it would be something that I enjoy in terms of a work life. IT in itself is such a broad field that can range from my job as a technician to a web developer. My experience of IT is quite basic with <br />
									   hardware and software, but it has definitely made me more technically savvy. </p>

										<h2><a href="#">Why did I study <br />
											at RMIT?</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>I chose to join RMIT because of the institution’s high reputation in its IT subjects. Additionally, the university has an online option which suites my schedule of having a full-time job. Its convenience and high reputation in IT is most likely the reason <br />
										students have chosen to study at RMIT. With choosing to study at RMIT, here are the 3 main skills I would be keen to learn: web development, Python and design. Elaborating on web <br />
										development, HTML and CSS will be the foundation on starting the journey of web development. Furthermore, to develop my knowledge on coding languages such as Python would aid in my interest in web design. Lastly, the design part of combining <br />
										HTML and aesthetics when building websites will be a challenge to learn because of its creative aspect. </p>

									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic04.jpg" alt="" /></a>
									<p><a> https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3359682603/?alternateChannel=search&refId=bbfqw7PWhuDwVS1hQ8KUEg%3D%3D&trackingId=%2FxtAc2qWzwIXK%2FEyjGokXQ%3D%3D</a><br />
										Here is an advertisement of a job application that would be ideal for my interests. The front-end developer position involves working with the Digital Performance team on the development and maintenance of the Nintendo Australia website. The individual will be responsible for coordinating updates to the website as well as being involved in coordinating digital projects, collaborating with global teams on project rollouts and strategy, and reviewing the performance digital projects. In addition, the individual will be responsible for ensuring that all executions meet the company's legal and ethical standards and that all deadlines are being met. As a career, being employed as a front-end developer for Nintendo certainly appeals to myself but it would be to many others. The employer, being Nintendo, provides any of its employees with a substantial amount of credibility because of its well-known name. Moreover, the position highlights the importance of implementing creativity and technical skills to design and improve the user interfaces for its website which I would be keen on being involved in.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">Current Experience</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>Currently I am working as an IT Consultant with over a year of experience in IT, where I am assigned inbound calls and make outbound calls when necessary. I am also a part of the software licensing team that procures software for staff at the university and handling multiple quotes from vendors to organise the purchase of software through the university. Being familiar with the use of Active Directory and Command Prompt to resolve issues end users are facing and assist end users with basic troubleshooting steps for hardware, software, and network issues via remote applications such as SCCM and TeamViewer. Additionally, maintaining an up-to-date knowledge of Windows and Mac Operating systems and applications such as Office365, Zoom, Cisco Jabber, and Cisco AnyConnect.

										<h2><a href="#">Current Plan</a></h2>
									</header>
									<p>The plan to obtain the skills, qualifications and experience for the front-end developer position is to first complete a degree in Information Technology at RMIT it requires formal qualifications. Secondly, to gain 2 years of experience in front-end developing by engaging in internships in the field. On top of this, being proficient in front-end languages and focusing on HTML, CSS and Javascript because these are the technical skills essential to the job description. While these skills will be done alongside the bachelor’s degree, extra studying can be accomplished by self-creating websites or projects on the side.</p>

										<h2><a href="#">MBTI test</a></h2>
									</header>
									<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic09.PNG" alt="" /></a>
									<p>
										The personality trait INFP (introverted, intuitive, feeling and perceiving) is my result for the Myers-Briggs personality test. Looking into the INFP trait, they tend to be sensitive, creative, and compassionate. Focusing on the creative characteristic, this is an advantage when engaging in group work as it provides the team with a creative perspective forming ideas. On the other hand, even though individuals who are a part of the INFP group are found to possess compassionate and caring qualities, the test emphasises they are most comfortable working independently than in a group setting. While this might be true, it highlights that people of this trait should find the opportunity to work in a team to improve themselves in this area. On a positive note, being a part of a team, they can showcase their mediation skills to assist with any future conflict that might arise. On a whole, being an INFP offers any team a great deal of advantages and disadvantages but it is how the individual themselves work around those disadvantages to overcome any endeavours. </p>

											<h2><a href="#">Learning Style test</a></h2>
										</header>
										<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/pic06.PNG" alt="" /></a>
										<p>
											Another test result is from the learning style test which splits into three distinct types: auditory, tactile, and visual. After being assigned as a tactile learner, the test informs that I learn the best with hands-on experience and physical activities. A handicap that may appear as a tactile learner is communicating ideas through online platforms. As online platforms are an easier way to communicate group work, it can be challenging to comprehend certain concepts just by messaging a team instead of face to face. A way to eliminate this issue is to suggest scheduling team meetings on a Zoom call or any platform that can be in a group call. This is to engage a tactile learner to grasp any complicated concepts with questions that can be answered by the team together.  </p>

												<h2><a href="#">DISC Personality test</a></h2>
											</header>
											<a href="#" class="image fit"><img src="images/disc.PNG" alt="" /></a>
											<p>
												The last test result is from the DISC personality test that assesses an individual’s personality and behavioural style into four styles: dominance, influence, steadiness and compliance. My test results produced a score of 38% in steadiness, 29% in dominance, 18% compliance and 15% in influence. With steadiness being at the top, it indicates that the individual tends to be reliable, patient and consistent in their behaviour. People with a high level of steadiness may be calm and patient in stressful situations and may be able to maintain their composure even when facing challenges or changes. While also being able to maintain a strong composure under pressure, it works in favour when dealing with group work when stressful issues appear. </p>

													<h2><a href="#">Forming a Team</a></h2>
												</header>
												<p>
													Considering the three test results (INFP, tactile and steadiness), here are the factors that I would need to look out for when forming a team. The first factor is to initiate an introduction within the team to create a solid foundation eliminating the any fears to consult in each other about future project issues. Secondly, setting small goals and due dates to reach the final outcome in terms of group work. This ensures that everyone is contributing and is on track with the group work but will always emphasise that if anyone is in need of help with the work to comfortably contact the members of the group. Lastly, my flexibility means that I am able to adapt to many different types of groups that I may join. Thus, forming the actual group is not as important as adapting to the group that I already am in.  </p>
